The\r\nfonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, \r\nredistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\r\nnames are not used by derivative works.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
